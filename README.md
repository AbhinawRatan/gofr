## Gofr
Gofr is an opinionated microservice development framework.

In order to fetch Gofr as a dependency
```bash
go get gofr.dev
```
## Goal
Even though generic applications can be written using Gofr, our main focus is to simplify the development of microservices. 
We will focus ourselves towards deployment in kubernetes and aspire to provide out-of-the-box observability.
